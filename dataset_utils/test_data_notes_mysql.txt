encountered mistakes:

  - avg(room_count) but column room_count does not exist (apartment_bookings)
  - how many 180s have legs won of 45? select max(180) does just return 180 instead of the amount of won legs of 45
  - inside max min brackets is as namer, which is not compatible
  - republican table as :_steve_sauerberg seems odd
  - intersect is a problematic statement 
  - some garbage data like:
        {
        "question": "What is the least 08-09 i/o best?",
        "context": "create table table_23938357_6 (id varchar, PRIMARY KEY (id))",
        "answer": "select min(08 as _09_i_o_best) from table_23938357_6"
        },
  - generally: difficulties by correctly capturing and inserting data for join operations
